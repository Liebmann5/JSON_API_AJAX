  // Another cool thing you can do is access your user's current location. Every browser has a built in navigator that can give you this information. The "navigator" will get the user's current longitude and latitude.
  // You/the user will see a prompt to allow or block this site from knowing your current location.
  if (navigator.geolocation) {   // First, it checks if the navigator.geolocation object exists.
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {   // If it does, the getCurrentPosition method on that object is called, which initiates an asynchronous request for the user's position.
    //^???I don't get this how does it look for a boolean? who determines that return value and register it as a boolean? and then how does it also somehow a request?? plus it knows asynchronous and not synchronous how???
      document.getElementById('data').innerHTML = "latitude: " + position.coords.latitude + "<br>longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;   // If the request is successful, the callback function in the method runs. This function accesses the position object's values for latitude and longitude using dot notation and updates the HTML.
      //??does .innerHTML() turn all strings to <p> or something??? What tags are outside of lat & long??? Also how does it know how much space to allow for it???{like CSS stuff}
