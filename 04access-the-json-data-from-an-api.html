        // Now you'll take a closer look at the returned data to better understand the JSON format. Recall some notation in JavaScript:

              /*[ ] -> Square brackets represent an array.
                { } -> Curly brackets represent an object.
                " " -> Double quotes represent a string. They are also used for key names in JSON.*/

        // Remember earlier that objects contain "key-value pairs" that are separated by commas. In the Cat Photo example, the first object has "id":0 where id is a key and 0 is its corresponding value. Similarly, there are keys for imageLink, altText, and codeNames. Each cat photo object has these same keys, but with different values.
        //An interesting "key-value pair" in the 1st object is "codeNames":["Juggernaut","Mrs. Wallace","ButterCup"]. Here codeNames is the key and its value is an array of three strings. It's possible to have "arrays of objects" as well as "a key with an array" as a value.
        // Remember how to access data in arrays and objects. Arrays use bracket notation to access a specific index of an item. Objects use either bracket or !!dot notation to access the value of a given property!!. Here's an example that prints the altText property of the first cat photo - note that the parsed JSON data in the editor is saved in a variable called json:     console.log(json[0].altText); //Think about it 1)access the string JSON element we made and then 2)we see that the value returned from the API is an array; most likely inside will be all the values/data we're looking for, then 3)1 of ways we know how to "access data inSIDE objects{1st sent}" is the dot notaton but because this value setup uses the "key-value pair" format we know to use the . notation because you use "dot notation, to access the value / of a given property"!!!!!!!!!!
        console.log(json[2].codeNames[1]);
        
      };

  SOOOOO...... in order to access the id of 2, that would be the last index of the array that json is = to
